	<div class="education">
		<p> I am currently on track on graduating with a Bachelor of Science
		with a major in Computing Science (and a minor in Classics) at the 
		University of Alberta graduating in April of 2016. I switched into the
		program, after partially completing an arts degree in Art and Design.
		</p>
		
		<p> I am in computer science at the University of Alberta, graduating
		in April of 2016. I hope to pursue design and programming in a career 
		upon graduating. I am constantly trying to grow as a developer in my
		professional career. 
		</p>
		
		<p> Languages I have knowledge in 
			<ul>
				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>SQL</li>
				<li>Prolog</li>
				<li>Lisp</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p> Design-wise, I enjoy bright colours and patterns. I have some 
		background in art and design through courses at the University of Alberta.
		I truly enjoy creating and bringing things to life. I have working knowledge in 
		Sketch for design purposes.

	<div class="Interests">
		<p> Besides programming, I enjoy playing games. The Legend of Zelda
		series is, and always will be a favourite of mine. It is what truely
		got me into enjoying computers. 
		</p>

		<p> Another large interest of mine is crafting.	Lately I have developed 
		a deep interest in crochet. Although I hope to soon try to make lace, 
		making animals is always a favourite of mine.
		</p>
		
		<p> I have been playing soccer since the age of 5. Although taking the current
		season off to focus on my last year of university, I am excited to play next season.
